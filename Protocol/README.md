Implementation for Security Levels 80, 112, and 128
80-bit Security Level

This security level corresponds to the Legacy category in the table. The specific parameters are as follows:

Symmetric Algorithm: 2TDEA (two-key 3DES), CBC mode

Elliptic Curve: 160-bit

Hash Function: SHA-1

Upgrade from 80-bit to 112-bit

According to the table, the parameters corresponding to the 112-bit security level are:

Symmetric Algorithm: AES-128 (or 3TDEA), CBC mode

Elliptic Curve: 224-bit

Hash Function: SHA-224

We choose AES-128 as the symmetric encryption algorithm.

Upgrade from 112-bit to 128-bit

The 128-bit security level corresponds to the following parameters:

Symmetric Algorithm: AES-128, CBC mode

Elliptic Curve: 256-bit

Hash Function: SHA-256
